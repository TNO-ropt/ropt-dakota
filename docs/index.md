# A Dakota plugin for `ropt`

The `ropt-dakota` package extends the [`ropt`](https://tno-ropt.github.io/ropt/dev/)
module by providing a plugin that integrates optimization algorithms from the
[Dakota](https://dakota.sandia.gov/) toolkit.  `ropt` itself is a robust
optimization framework designed for both continuous and discrete optimization
workflows and is extensible through its plugin architecture. Installing
`ropt-dakota` makes these Dakota algorithms directly available within `ropt`.
